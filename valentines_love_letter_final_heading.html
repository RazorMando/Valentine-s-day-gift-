        Valeria, mi amor, it's been about 3 months since we first met. It's funny and, like, very, very, *very* silly how we met. 
        It started from being mean and having bad first impressions to playing *Roblox* together. Even before we dated, you were an 
        awesome friend‚Äîmy best friend. You are such a nice and kind person, very gentle. I remember when I started having feelings 
        for you‚ÄîI felt so silly and stuff. It broke my heart to hear about what you went through when you were young and the things 
        your dad did. I really, *really* loved you but felt so guilty for having these feelings for you when you told me what all 
        your male friends did. Unlike them, I didn't just like you because of your looks or because I wanted a girlfriend‚Äîit was 
        because I saw through you and fell in love with the person you are and your nature.  
    </div>

    <button class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleContent('promises')">Promises üíï</button>
    <div id="promises" class="content-box">
        I'm going to study really, *really* hard so that I get good pay and a good place in Mexico. I've also been thinking‚Äîwhen I 
        come over there, as hard as it would be to convince your mom, I want you and your mom to move over to my place when I'm in 
        Mexico. We will all live happily together.  
        I love you so much, Valeria‚Äîmy gorgeous girlfriend, my beautiful wife, my love, my everything. *Te amo mucho, mucho*, Valeria, 
        *mi cari√±o*. I will make you the happiest girl in the whole world. I will try my best to be the best boyfriend‚Äîand in the far 
        future, the best husband and dad to our kids.  
    </div>

    <button class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleContent('about_you')">About You üíñ</button>
    <div id="about_you" class="content-box">
        When I met you, you were the most innocent and kindest person I have ever met. Your childlike tendencies and innocence are not flaws but rather rare and precious qualities. I consider myself lucky to call you my girlfriend because you have the best attributes. No matter what you've been through, you never let it define you‚Äîyou are incredibly strong and determined.  

        You work so hard at such a young age, and I know you are destined for great things. You have the **most beautiful eyes**‚Äîtheir color and shape are like a magnet to me, and every time I look into them, I fall in love with you all over again. üíï *No me mires con esos ojos... hehe*‚Äîjust kidding! Please never stop looking at me with those heavenly eyes.  

        Your personality is like that of a butterfly‚Äîcalm, gentle, and effortlessly beautiful. I **love** all of your little interests and talents. You introduced me to *Touhou*, and now I find it incredibly fascinating! I love when you talk about the characters and show me your plushies. Your artwork is **so unique and creative**, and I admire everything you create. And let‚Äôs not even talk about your sculpting skills‚Äî**self-taught and already amazing?!** That‚Äôs incredible!  

        There‚Äôs so much depth to your personality, and I‚Äôm always fascinated when I learn something new about you. I can't wait to know more and more about you, because you are **such an interesting and wonderful person**!  
        **Te amo mucho, Valeria.** ‚ù§Ô∏è
